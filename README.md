# ClusterFilm

ClusterFilm is an in-progress MERN stack project utilizing [themoviedb.org's](https://www.themoviedb.org/) [api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). The goal of ClusterFilm is to give users a place to explore and discover new films and tv shows. Users are able to create clusters, or collections of films. In the future, I plan on incorporating the ability for users to communicate and collaborate on clusters to provide a more engaging platform where people can socialize and create connections with others through shared interests in cinematography.

I utilized The Movie Database's API to populate the site with content and search results, an Express backend to handle API requests, MongoDB to store the user-generated clusters, Auth0 to authenticate users, and React to create a dynamic presentation of information to the user.
